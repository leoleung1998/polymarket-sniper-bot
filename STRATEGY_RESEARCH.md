## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Polymarket ecosystem has matured dramatically. Weekly volume exceeds $1.5 billion, and the market is now dominated by sophisticated bots. Key statistics:

- Only **16.8% of wallets** show a net gain
- Only **0.51% of wallets** achieved profits exceeding $1,000
- Average arbitrage opportunity duration: **2.7 seconds** (down from 12.3s in 2024)
- **73% of arbitrage profits** captured by sub-100ms execution bots
- Estimated **$40 million** in arbitrage profits extracted Apr 2024 - Apr 2025
- Polymarket charges a **2% fee on net winnings** (plus new taker fees in crypto/sports markets)
- Gas on Polygon is negligible (~$0.01 per transaction)

**Bottom line**: Pure speed-based arbitrage is effectively dead for retail. The profitable strategies in 2026 are AI-powered probability modeling, weather/domain-specific bots, crypto latency arbitrage, market making with rewards, and systematic copy trading.

## STRATEGY DEEP DIVES

### 1. AI/LLM-POWERED PROBABILITY MODELS (BEST RISK/REWARD)

**How it works**: Use AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini) to synthesize data from multiple sources (NOAA forecasts, news feeds, social media, on-chain activity) and calculate a "true" probability for an event. Compare this to the Polymarket price. If the AI model says 75% but Polymarket says 60%, you have a 15% edge -- buy.

**The $2.2M Example**: Trader "ilovecircle" (Igor Mikerin) earned $2.2 million in 60 days using:
- Anthropic's Claude AI as a coding partner
- Python scripts connecting to the Polymarket API
- Ensemble probability models trained on news + social data
- ~74% accuracy across thousands of trades in sports, crypto, and politics
- Logic: If model says 75% and market says 60%, buy. Repeat thousands of times.

**Weather Bot Sub-Strategy** (most accessible):
- Pull NOAA forecast data, compare to Polymarket weather market prices
- Entry threshold: 15% edge (buy when forecast probability >= 15% above market)
- Exit threshold: 45% edge or profit target hit
- Max position: $2-5 per trade
- One address scaled $1,000 to $24,000 trading London weather markets since April 2025
- Another bot printed $65,000 in profits across NYC, London, Seoul weather events
- Tools: OpenClaw + Simmer SDK (no-code option available)

**Risk**: Medium. Models can be wrong; markets can be right.
**Capital**: $500-$5,000 starting
**Returns**: 10-50%+ monthly when working
**Complexity**: High (need to build/tune models)
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 2. CRYPTO LATENCY ARBITRAGE (5/15-MINUTE MARKETS)

**How it works**: Polymarket offers 5-minute and 15-minute "Up or Down" markets for BTC, ETH, SOL, and others. These markets resolve based on Chainlink oracles, but Polymarket prices LAG behind spot prices on Binance/Coinbase by seconds to minutes.

**The $313 to $414K Example**: One bot turned $313 into $414,000 in a single month:
- Traded exclusively BTC, ETH, SOL 15-minute up/down markets
- 98% win rate
- $4,000-$5,000 bets per trade
- Exploited the window where Polymarket prices lag confirmed spot momentum

**Execution Strategy**:
- In the final 30-60 seconds of a 5-min window, calculate implied probability from live crypto feeds vs. Polymarket odds
- Bet only if >5-10% edge exists (after fees and slippage)
- Last 5-7 seconds amplify edge if you have low-latency access
- Polymarket liquidity is thinner in short-term markets ($5K-$50K per window)

**Risk**: Medium-High. Requires speed infrastructure; strategies can get crowded.
**Capital**: $1K-$10K
**Returns**: 20-100%+ monthly (exceptional cases much higher)
**Complexity**: High (need low-latency infra, real-time data feeds)
**Fully automatable**: Yes -- this IS a bot strategy

---

### 3. HIGH-PROBABILITY BOND GRINDING ("FAVORITE COMPOUNDER")

**How it works**: Find markets where one outcome is trading at 95+ cents with resolution imminent. Buy that side and collect 3-5% yield when it resolves to $1.00 within hours or days.

**Example**: "Will the Fed cut rates in December?" -- NO trading at 95 cents with meeting 3 days away. Buy NO at 95 cents, collect $1.00 = 5.2% yield in 72 hours. Annualized, that is ~700%+.

**Key parameters**:
- Target: Markets priced 95c+ with resolution within 1-7 days
- Yield per trade: 3-7%
- Stack multiple simultaneously for portfolio-level returns
- Risk: tail events (the 5% chance materializes)

**Risk**: Very Low (but not zero -- tail risk is real)
**Capital**: $5K-$50K (need volume since margins are thin)
**Returns**: 5-15% monthly when stacked across many positions
**Complexity**: Low
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 4. MARKET MAKING + LIQUIDITY REWARDS

**How it works**: Place buy and sell orders on both sides of a market, earning the bid-ask spread. Additionally earn Polymarket's liquidity reward payments (distributed daily at midnight UTC).

**Key mechanics**:
- Place buy limit order below mid, sell limit order above mid
- Earn spread when both sides fill
- Polymarket rewards: quadratic formula heavily favors tight quotes near midpoint
- Being 2x tighter than competitors approximately 4x your rewards
- Win rate: 78-85%
- Returns: 0.5-2% monthly from spread + additional liquidity rewards

**Market selection**: Low volatility + high volume markets preferred. Analyze historical price movements across 3hr, 24hr, 7-day, 30-day windows.

**Professional market maker income**: $150-300 per day per market with $100K+ daily volume, plus liquidity rewards.

**Warning**: The most-starred market making repo (poly-maker, 922 stars) explicitly warns: "In today's market, this bot is not profitable and will lose money." Competition has intensified significantly.

**Risk**: Low (inventory risk if market moves directionally)
**Capital**: $10K-$100K
**Returns**: 1-3% monthly
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 5. EVENT-DRIVEN / NEWS CATALYST TRADING

**How it works**: When breaking news occurs, Polymarket prices lag by 30 seconds to several minutes. First movers capture 20-50% of the eventual price movement.

**Two sub-strategies**:

A) **Speed-based information arbitrage**: See news first, act first. Markets take 3-15 minutes to fully price in breaking news.

B) **Fading overreactions**: When prices spike irrationally on news, bet on mean reversion. Markets frequently overshoot, pushing prices to extremes before correcting.

**Domain specialization advantage**: If you are an expert in law, science, geopolitics, or another niche, you can identify mispricing faster than generalist bots. Bots cannot replicate deep domain knowledge.

**Risk**: Medium-High
**Capital**: $1K-$10K
**Returns**: 5-20% monthly (highly variable)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Fully automatable**: Partially (A can be automated; B requires judgment)

---

### 6. CROSS-PLATFORM ARBITRAGE (POLYMARKET vs KALSHI)

**How it works**: Same event trades at different prices on Polymarket (decentralized, Polygon) and Kalshi (CFTC-regulated). Buy YES on one platform + NO on the other when combined cost < $1.00.

**Example**: BTC > $95K -- YES at 45 cents on Polymarket, NO at 48 cents on Kalshi. Total cost: 93 cents. Guaranteed payout: $1.00. Profit: 7 cents (7.5% return).

**Current reality** (2026):
- Average opportunity duration: 2.7 seconds
- 73% of profits captured by sub-100ms bots
- Median spread: 0.3% (barely profitable after fees)
- Cross-platform execution adds settlement risk (different chains, different settlement times)

**Risk**: Near-zero if executed simultaneously, but execution risk is real
**Capital**: $5K-$20K (need funds on both platforms)
**Returns**: 2-5% monthly
**Complexity**: High (dual API integration, fast execution)
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 7. COPY TRADING (WHALE TRACKING)

**How it works**: Every Polymarket transaction is on-chain (Polygon). Track wallets with strong track records and mirror their high-conviction trades.

**Best practices** (from research on 1.3M wallets):
- Build baskets of 5-10 wallets (single-whale copying is fragile)
- Use 80% consensus rule (only trade when 4/5 whales agree)
- Filter: 60%+ win rate AND 50+ closed trades (edge, not luck)
- Look for 30+ day track records with consistent positive returns
- Position sizing: 0.1x to 0.3x ratio relative to target wallet
- Early entries (days before news) = higher EV but higher risk
- Late entries (hours after news) = lower risk, lower upside

**Tools**: PolyTrack (most comprehensive), Polywhaler, Arkham Intelligence, Chrome Whale Tracker extension

**Risk**: Medium (even best traders have rough patches)
**Capital**: $500-$5K
**Returns**: Variable, 10-50%+ when following good signals
**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 8. COMBINATORIAL / MULTI-OUTCOME ARBITRAGE

**How it works**: In multi-outcome markets (e.g., "Who wins the Oscar for Best Picture?"), sum all cheapest ask prices. If total < $1.00, buy all outcomes for guaranteed profit.

**Also**: Logical arbitrage across correlated markets. If "Trump wins" is at 55% but "Republican wins" is at 50%, that is a logical impossibility (Trump winning implies Republican winning). Construct multi-leg positions to exploit.

**Academic backing**: IMDEA Networks Institute documented $40M in arbitrage from this approach (Apr 2024 - Apr 2025). Two distinct forms: Market Rebalancing Arbitrage (within single market) and Combinatorial Arbitrage (across markets).

**Challenges**:
- Max position capped by least liquid leg
- Polymarket 2% fee on winnings eats into thin margins
- Formula: Profit = $1.00 - (sum of asks) - (0.02 x $1.00)
- Advanced systems use LLMs to discover logical connections between related markets

**Risk**: Low
**Capital**: $5K-$20K
**Returns**: 2-5% monthly
**Complexity**: Very High (need to model logical relationships)
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 9. BINARY COMPLEMENT ARBITRAGE (YES + NO < $1)

**How it works**: In any binary market, if YES ask + NO ask < $1.00, buy both for guaranteed profit at resolution.

**Example**: Fed rate cut market -- YES at 27 cents, NO at 71 cents (98 cents total). Buy both for 98 cents, guaranteed $1.00 payout, 2 cent profit.

**Current state**: This strategy is essentially dead for retail in 2026. Opportunities last 2.7 seconds on average and are captured by bots with sub-100ms execution. The median spread is 0.3%.

**Risk**: Near-zero
**Capital**: $10K+ (margins are tiny)
**Returns**: <1% monthly for retail
**Complexity**: Medium
**Fully automatable**: Yes (but you need HFT-level infrastructure to compete)

---

### 10. MOMENTUM / MEAN REVERSION

**How it works**:
- **Momentum**: When prices move sharply in one direction (usually from news), bet the move continues. Trade in the direction of the price movement and close quickly.
- **Mean reversion**: When prices spike irrationally, bet they return to the average. Works best for overreactions and short-term divergences.

**Combined approach**: A bot implementing momentum + mean-reversion works well in high-liquidity Polymarket crypto markets. Momentum has lower win rate but larger moves (hold 1-2 weeks). Mean reversion has higher win rate but smaller moves (1-3 day trades).

**Risk**: High (directional risk)
**Capital**: $1K-$10K
**Returns**: Variable
**Complexity**: Medium
**Fully automatable**: Yes

---

### 11. SETTLEMENT RULES EDGE TRADING

**How it works**: Analyze the actual resolution criteria of markets (not just the headline). When "headline truth" diverges from technical settlement language, exploit the gap.

**Example**: A government shutdown market might trade based on chaos headlines, but the actual resolution criteria depends on very specific technical language about what constitutes a "shutdown." Traders who read the rules carefully can find edge.

**Risk**: Low-Medium
**Capital**: $1K-$5K
**Returns**: 2-5% per winning trade
**Complexity**: Medium (requires careful reading, not automation)
**Fully automatable**: No (requires human judgment)

---

### 12. LOW-PROBABILITY SNIPING

**How it works**: Buy shares at sub-3 cents in markets with extremely unlikely outcomes. If the unlikely event occurs, massive payout. Also: "Obvious No" strategy -- buy NO at 97 cents on markets like "Will aliens make contact?" and collect 3% when it resolves.

**Three types of sniping**:
1. Market open sniping (mispriced initial odds)
2. Order sniping (fat-finger errors, large orders hitting thin books)
3. Resolution sniping (buying right before resolution when outcome is known)

**Risk**: Very High (for YES side; lower for "obvious NO" grinding)
**Capital**: $100-$1K
**Returns**: Lottery-like on YES side; 3-5% per trade on NO grinding
**Complexity**: Low
**Fully automatable**: Partially (NO grinding is automatable)

## WALLET & LEADERBOARD ANALYSIS

### Key Findings from Analyzing 1.3M+ Wallets

1. **Only 16.8% of wallets are profitable** -- the vast majority lose money
2. **Single-whale copy trading is fragile** -- even the best traders have rough patches
3. **Basket approach outperforms** -- 5-10 wallets with 80% consensus rule
4. **Top traders specialize** -- politics, sports, crypto, or weather. Generalists underperform.

### What Top Traders Do Differently

- Use **structured probability frameworks** (not gut feeling)
- **Domain specialization** -- deep expertise in one area
- **Position sizing discipline** -- 1-2% of capital per trade
- **Speed infrastructure** -- first movers capture 20-50% of price movement
- **Multiple strategies** -- not dependent on single approach

### Wallet Selection Criteria for Copy Trading

- Win rate > 60%
- 50+ closed trades (statistically significant)
- 30+ consecutive days of positive returns
- Total profits significantly exceed total losses
- Avoid wallets with single large wins (luck, not edge)

## FEE STRUCTURE & COST ANALYSIS

### Polymarket Fees (as of 2026)

| Fee Type | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Trading (maker) | 0% |
| Trading (taker, crypto 5/15-min markets) | Up to 1.56% at 50% probability |
| Trading (taker, select sports) | Variable |
| Net winnings | 2% |
| Polygon gas | ~$0.01 per transaction |
| Deposit | 0% |
| Withdrawal | Polygon gas only |

### Profitability Formula

```
Net Profit = Gross Profit - (2% net winnings fee) - (taker fees if applicable) - (gas costs)
```

For arbitrage:
```
Arbitrage Profit = $1.00 - (YES Ask + NO Ask) - (0.02 x $1.00) - gas
```

### API Rate Limits

- 60 orders per minute per API key
- Exponential backoff required for rate limit handling

## QUANT RESEARCH NOTES — Session March 2026

> Deep-dive notes from building and extending the v6 pairs bot. Covers pairs trading math, lead-lag, OFA, perp L/S construction, and model validation framework.

### Delta-Neutral Pairs Trading (Polymarket v6)

**What we built vs classic pairs trading:**

| | Our Polymarket bot | Classic pairs trading |
|---|---|---|
| Bet | Both coins move SAME direction | Spread CONVERGES to mean |
| Legs | Long A_up + Long B_down (same direction) | Long underperformer + Short outperformer |
| Edge source | Sum < $1.00 (structural mispricing) | Z-score deviation from historical mean |
| Exit | Binary resolution at window close | When spread reverts |
| Correlation role | Entry filter (ρ > sum) | Hedge ratio calculator |
| P&L | Binary $0 or $1/share | Continuous mark-to-market |

**Core math:**
```
sum_1 = price_a_up + price_b_down   # scenario: A up, B down
sum_2 = price_a_down + price_b_up   # scenario: A down, B up
best_sum = min(sum_1, sum_2)         # always take cheaper direction
edge     = 1 - best_sum

EV = ρ×(1-sum) - (1-ρ)×sum
Break-even identity: EV=0 exactly when ρ=sum

→ sum=0.86 needs ρ > 0.86 to profit
→ sum=0.78 needs ρ > 0.78 to profit
→ flat MIN_RHO=0.80 is WRONG for sum=0.86 (negative EV at ρ=0.82)
```

**Proper Kelly for pairs:**
```
b = (1-sum)/sum               # net win per unit stake
f* = (ρ×b - (1-ρ)) / b       # full Kelly
quarter-Kelly = f* × 0.25 × balance

Example: ρ=0.95, sum=0.86, $100 balance
  b = 0.14/0.86 = 0.163
  f* = (0.95×0.163 - 0.05) / 0.163 = 64.3%
  quarter-Kelly spend = 0.25 × 0.643 × $100 = $16.07
```

**EV is correlation-invariant but variance is not:**
```
Lower ρ → more jackpot wins AND more total losses → higher variance, same EV
What kills EV is sum rising above break-even (fees), not correlation dropping.
```

### EWMA-Weighted Pearson Correlation

**Why over simple Pearson:**
- Equal-weight treats candle from 100min ago same as 5min ago
- EWMA detects correlation regime changes in 2-3 candles vs 10+
- Half-life at λ=0.90: recent candle weighs ~10× more than oldest

**Formula:**
```python
weights = [λ^(n-1-i) for i in range(n)]   # oldest → newest
w_sum = sum(weights)
mx = Σ(w_i × x_i) / w_sum
cov  = Σ w_i(x_i - mx)(y_i - my)
ρ    = cov / sqrt(var_x × var_y)
β    = cov / var_y    # hedge ratio (notional, not base qty — see below)
```

**Tuning (PAIRS_EWMA_DECAY in .env):**
| λ | Half-life (5-min) | Half-life (15-min) | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.85 | 4 candles (20 min) | 4 candles (1h) | Very reactive, noisy |
| 0.90 | 6 candles (30 min) | 6 candles (1.5h) | Balanced (default) |
| 0.94 | 11 candles (55 min) | 11 candles (2.75h) | Smooth, slow to react |

---

### Perp Long/Short Construction

**Spread construction:**
```
spread_t = log(BTC_t) - β × log(ETH_t)
β = Cov(r_BTC, r_ETH) / Var(r_ETH)
```

**β is in NOTIONAL terms, not base quantity:**
```
β=0.70 means: short $700 ETH per $1,000 BTC long
NOT: short 0.70 ETH per 1 BTC (would be ~2× overhedged)

In base qty:
  btc_qty = notional / btc_price
  eth_qty = (notional × β) / eth_price

Base qty ratio drifts as prices move. Always store β as notional, convert at order time.
```

**Z-score entry:**
```
z = (spread_t - mean_spread) / std_spread
z > +2  →  BTC expensive vs ETH  →  SHORT BTC, LONG ETH
z < -2  →  ETH expensive vs BTC  →  LONG BTC, SHORT ETH
exit: |z| < 0.5  |  stop: |z| > 4.0
```

**Why basic z-score model struggles:**
1. BTC/ETH spread doesn't mean-revert — regime shifts are permanent
2. Extremely crowded (every quant fund runs it)
3. Funding rates (0.03-0.1%/8h) eat the ~0.3% edge
4. Need: ADF cointegration test, regime filter, less crowded pairs

### Lead-Lag and Cross-Exchange Arbitrage

**Information flow hierarchy in crypto:**
```
Binance BTC spot → Binance BTC perp → ETH perp → SOL → smaller alts
     ~0ms              ~50ms            ~100ms    ~200ms
```

**Retail-viable approach — limit-limit (not market-market):**
```
Naive arb (you lose to HFT):
  See Binance tick up → market order OKX → already done

Lead-lag limit (speed-tolerant):
  Detect Binance order flow bullish
  → place limit BUY on OKX at current ask BEFORE it reprices
  → Binance ticks up 2s later, OKX reprices
  → your limit fills at the old (better) price
```

**Detecting lead-lag dynamically:**

1. **Cross-correlation function (CCF):**
```python
# Peak lag where correlation is highest = lead time in ms
# Positive peak = A leads B, negative = B leads A
```

2. **Granger causality:**
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests
# p < 0.05 at lag L = A Granger-causes B with L-period lead
```

3. **Hasbrouck Information Share:**
```
# Fraction of price discovery at each venue
# IS > 0.5 = that venue leads price discovery
# Requires VAR model on mid-price series
```

**Alpha decay measurement:**
```python
for horizon in [1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120]:  # seconds
    IC = corr(signal_at_t, return_at_{t+horizon})
    # IC half-life = optimal hold time
    # Typical BTC/ETH cross-exchange: decay at 30-60s
```

**Latency window by execution speed:**
| Lag duration | Who can trade it |
|---|---|
| < 10ms | Co-located HFT only |
| 10ms-100ms | HFT with good infra |
| 100ms-1s | Fast algo (cloud) |
| 1s-60s | Retail algo with fast API |
| > 60s | Anyone — edge smaller |

### Order Flow Alpha (OFA)

**Core concept:** Aggressive market orders reveal private information before price moves.

```
OFI = aggressive_buy_volume - aggressive_sell_volume
OFI > 0 → buying pressure → price ticks up soon

Aggressive BUY  = market order hitting the ask (buyer is urgent)
Aggressive SELL = market order hitting the bid (seller is urgent)
```

**Three levels:**
1. **Basic OFI:** count buy/sell volume in rolling window
2. **Orderbook OFI (Stoikov 2021):** watch bid/ask qty changes tick by tick
3. **Multi-level OFI:** full 10-level depth, each weighted

**Why better than price signals:**
```
OFI IC at 1s horizon:          0.15-0.30
Price momentum IC at 1s:       0.03-0.08
→ 3-5× more predictive at sub-minute
```

**Binance data source — free, real-time:**
```python
# aggTrade WebSocket stream
# m=False → aggressive BUY  (buyer hit ask)
# m=True  → aggressive SELL (seller hit bid)
```

**What v5 maker already does:** price move % as proxy for cumulative OFI.
Real OFI replaces it with aggTrade stream — more signal, less lag.

### Model Validation Framework

**Statistical tests (in priority order):**

1. **T-test on returns** — is mean return significantly > 0?
   - Need: p < 0.05, t > 2.0, n > 100 trades minimum

2. **Out-of-sample test** — most important
   - IS: develop + tune | OOS: final test, never touch during development
   - OOS Sharpe < 50% of IS Sharpe → overfit

3. **Permutation test** — destroys signal, checks if results are luck
   - Shuffle returns 10,000 times
   - Real Sharpe > 95th percentile of shuffled → edge is real

4. **Walk-forward validation** — roll the IS/OOS window forward
   - Concatenate all OOS periods → real out-of-sample performance curve

**Key metrics:**
| Metric | Minimum | Good | Excellent |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| Sharpe (annualised) | >1.0 | >2.0 | >3.0 |
| Max drawdown | <20% | <10% | <5% |
| Profit factor | >1.2 | >1.5 | >2.0 |
| Information Ratio (OOS) | >0.5 | >1.0 | >2.0 |

**Attribution analysis:**
- Break P&L by regime (volatility, time of day, signal strength)
- IC decay curve on live trades (where does the signal actually work?)
- Fee attribution (gross - fees - funding = how much survives?)

**Red flags:**
```
OOS Sharpe < 50% of IS        → overfit, simplify model
All alpha in 3-5 trades        → luck not system, remove outliers and retest
Gross positive, net negative   → fees eating edge, raise selectivity
P&L flat after initial period  → regime change, model needs retraining
Win rate high, profit factor <1.2 → cutting winners early / letting losers run
```

**The summary number:**
```
Information Ratio (OOS) > 0.5 on 6+ months clean OOS data
+ permutation p-value < 0.01
= model worth deploying with real capital
```

### Reusable Components for Perp L/S Strategy

Everything in `arb_engine_v6_pairs.py` that can be directly reused:

| Component | Reuse for perp L/S |
|---|---|
| `CandleTracker._returns` | Same returns series, plug into CCF |
| `_ewma_pearson` | Extend to `_ewma_beta_and_rho` — returns (β, ρ) together |
| `bootstrap_candle_history` | Same Binance REST kline fetch |
| `binance_feed` | Already streaming, add `aggTrade` for OFI |
| `EWMA_DECAY` config | Same decay parameter |

New pieces needed:
```
1. OKX/Bybit WebSocket feed   (parallel to binance_feed.py)
2. Spread series tracker       (log(BTC) - β×log(ETH) per window)
3. Z-score calculator          (rolling mean + std of spread)
4. cross_correlation_lags()    (pure numpy, CCF for dynamic lead detection)
5. alpha_decay_curve()         (run offline on historical data first)
6. Limit order on laggard      (exchange connector — CCXT or direct)
7. Funding rate monitor        (cost that erodes edge, check every 8h)
8. Mark-to-market exit         (continuous P&L vs binary resolution)
```
