# Polymarket Sniper Bot

Automated trading bot for Polymarket prediction markets. Three strategies, one codebase. Run it locally in 5 minutes, or go full autopilot with cloud deployment and AI-powered remote control.

**Start simple. Add complexity when you're ready.**

| Level | What You Get | Time to Set Up |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Basic** | Bot runs on your laptop, you watch the terminal | 5 minutes |
| **+ Telegram Alerts** | Get trade notifications on your phone | +2 minutes |
| **+ Cloud Deployment** | Bot runs 24/7 even when your laptop is closed | +20 minutes |
| **+ AI Control Bot** | Message your bot from your phone, Claude AI diagnoses issues and makes fixes | +5 minutes |

## The Three Strategies

1. **Weather Bracket Bot** — Trades daily weather temperature brackets using the GFS 31-member ensemble forecast. Counts how many ensemble members land in each bracket to compute probability. Buys when edge > 8%.
2. **Crypto Maker Bot** — Trades 15-min BTC/ETH/SOL up/down markets. Posts GTC limit orders at $0.88-0.95 on the likely winning side 8 minutes before window close, filtered by Allium on-chain smart money signals. Zero taker fees + maker rebates. Running at **88% win rate**.
3. **Sniper** — Buys outcomes priced under 3 cents. High volume, low cost, lottery-ticket math.

# Level 1: Run Locally (5 minutes)

Everything you need to get trading. No cloud, no Telegram, no API keys beyond Polymarket.

### Step 1: Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylecwalden/polymarket-sniper-bot.git
cd polymarket-sniper-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Get your Polymarket credentials

1. Go to [polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com) and create an account (deposit at least $20 USDC)
2. Click your profile icon (top right) > **Cash** > **...** (three dots) > **Export Private Key**
3. Open `.env` in any editor and fill in:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address_here
   SIGNATURE_TYPE=1    # 1 = email login, 0 = MetaMask/EOA wallet
   ```

### Step 3: Connect VPN and run

Polymarket blocks US IPs. Connect [ProtonVPN](https://pr.tn/ref/WMF7NFH4) (or any VPN) to a non-US server, then:

```bash
# Pick your strategy:
python bot.py bracket     # Weather bot (recommended to start)
python bot.py maker       # Crypto maker (15-min BTC/ETH/SOL)
python bot.py dual        # Both in parallel

# Utilities:
python bot.py scan        # Preview cheap outcomes without buying
python bot.py positions   # Check your P&L
```

**That's it.** The bot scans Polymarket, finds edges, and places trades. You'll see everything in your terminal. Keep it running as long as you want — close it anytime with `Ctrl+C`.

---

# Level 2: Add Telegram Alerts (+2 minutes)

Get notifications on your phone for every trade, win, loss, and status update. No more watching the terminal.

1. Open Telegram, search for **@BotFather**, send `/newbot`, follow the prompts, copy the **bot token**
2. Search for **@userinfobot**, send any message, copy your **chat ID**
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id
   ```
4. Restart the bot. You'll now get messages like:

   > 🎯 **NEW TRADE PLACED**
   > *Dallas High Temp Above 75°F*
   > Betting: YES @ $0.42/share
   > Cost: $5.00 (11 shares)
   > Edge: 12.3% over market
   > If we win: +$6.38 profit

---

# Level 3: Deploy to the Cloud (+20 minutes)

Run the bot 24/7 on a cloud server so it keeps trading when your laptop is closed, sleeping, or off.

**Recommended:** [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) — 12 months free on a t3.micro instance. Pick a European region (like Ireland) and you get a non-US IP automatically, so you don't even need a VPN.

The setup is the same as Level 1 — just do it on a cloud server instead of your laptop:

1. Spin up a Linux instance (Ubuntu 22.04) on AWS, DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.
2. SSH in, clone the repo, install dependencies, create `.env`
3. Run with `nohup python bot.py dual &` or set up a systemd service for auto-restart on crashes

**Pro tip:** If you pick an EU region, set `PROTON_VPN_REQUIRED=false` in your `.env` — the server's IP is already non-US.

---

# Level 4: AI-Powered Remote Control (+5 minutes)

This is the fun one. Add a Claude AI brain to your Telegram bot so you can control everything from your phone using natural language.

**What it does:** You message your Telegram bot, Claude reads your code and logs, diagnoses issues, edits files, restarts services — all from your phone. It's like having a DevOps engineer on call 24/7.

**Requires:** An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com) (~$0.01-0.05 per message)

1. Sign up at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and create an API key
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
   ```
3. Run the control bot (in addition to your trading bot):
   ```bash
   python telegram_control.py
   ```
4. Message your Telegram bot:

   | Message | What Happens |
   |---------|-------------|
   | `/status` | Bot health, bankroll, P&L at a glance |
   | `/logs` | Recent activity from both bots |
   | `/restart` | Restart the trading bots |
   | `/pause` / `/resume` | Pause or resume trading |
   | *"Why aren't any trades going through?"* | Claude reads logs and code, tells you what's wrong |
   | *"Lower the edge threshold to 5%"* | Claude edits the config and restarts the bot |
   | *"How much have we made today?"* | Claude checks P&L and gives you a summary |

## How the Strategies Work

### Weather Bracket Bot (`python bot.py bracket`)

Trades daily temperature bracket markets across 20+ global cities (Dallas, Seoul, Tokyo, London, etc.)

**The edge:** We use the GFS 31-member ensemble from Open-Meteo's free API. Each ensemble member runs a slightly different simulation of the atmosphere. If 28/31 members predict a high above 70°F, that's a 90.3% probability — far more accurate than a single-forecast guess. When Polymarket prices a bracket at 50% but our ensemble says 90%, we buy.

**Flow:**
1. Fetches GFS 31-member ensemble from Open-Meteo (`ensemble-api.open-meteo.com`)
2. Counts how many members land in each temperature bracket
3. Compares ensemble probability vs Polymarket price
4. When edge > 8%, places GTC limit order at the real orderbook best ask (auto-cancels after 20s if unfilled)
5. Falls back to NOAA/Open-Meteo single forecast + normal distribution if ensemble unavailable
6. Skips single-degree brackets (too noisy for ensemble resolution)
7. Skips cities past 4 PM local time (observation window closed)

**Why this works:** The [top weather bots on Polymarket ($24K+ profit)](https://blog.devgenius.io/found-the-weather-trading-bots-quietly-making-24-000-on-polymarket-and-built-one-myself-for-free-120bd34d6f09) all use GFS ensemble counting. Single-forecast models can't compete.

### Crypto Maker Bot (`python bot.py maker`)

Trades 15-minute BTC/ETH/SOL "Up or Down" markets using a maker (limit order) strategy.

**Why taker arbitrage is dead:** In Feb 2026, Polymarket introduced [dynamic taker fees up to 3.15%](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/polymarket-introduces-dynamic-fees-to-curb-latency-arbitrage-in-short-term-crypto-markets/) and removed the 500ms taker delay. The old strategy of FOK-ing the spread no longer works.

**The new strategy:**
1. Connects to Binance WebSocket for real-time BTC/ETH/SOL prices
2. Tracks price from the start of each 15-min window
3. At T-480 seconds (8 min) before window close: checks if price has moved >0.1% in one direction
4. Queries **Allium on-chain data** for smart money confirmation — if wallets with 70%+ win rates disagree with the direction, the trade is blocked
5. If direction is clear AND smart money agrees → posts GTC maker bid at $0.88-0.95 on the likely winning side
6. If ambiguous (< 0.1% move) or smart money contradicts → skips
7. 8 minutes on the orderbook gives plenty of time for fills. After window close: collect $1.00/share on wins.

**Why this works:** Entering 8 minutes early gives orders time to fill, while the Allium smart money filter catches bad direction calls. We only trade when Binance price direction AND on-chain whale flow agree. Running at **88% win rate (7W/1L)** since adding the Allium filter. Maker orders = zero fees + maker rebates.

### Sniper Mode (`python bot.py scan` / `run`)

Scans all active Polymarket events for outcomes priced under 3 cents. Places small bets on extreme long shots with asymmetric upside.

**The math:** Buy 100 outcomes at $0.02 each = $200 total. If 1 wins = $500 payout.
